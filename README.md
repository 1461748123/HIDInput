HIDInput
========

HIDInput was a human interface device synthesizer project I developed in April of 2014. The driver registers with mouclass and kbdclass as an input provider. This way, keyboard and mouse input can be synthesized on the whim of a system thread from kernel mode. This project was never meant to be public and this is the reason for the lackluster code quality. However, due to theft and misuse of this project, I have decided to release the code under the GPL. I will add comments as I am afforded the time.
